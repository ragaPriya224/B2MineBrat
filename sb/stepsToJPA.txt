1. new maven project -> finish
2. dep to add -> h2db, jpa 

to do: 1. tell where db is ..(cnnection string..etc)
       2. how to connect 
       
 * we created a simple java class named JpaStarterMain 
 * -------- create a model class, persistence context ----------
 
 src-> main-> resources -> meta-inf -> persistence.xml created
 this file contains persistence context 
        -> bunch of info's about what db 
        -> location
        -? connection stringlike userid, pwd, 
        -> how jpa needs to behave
        -> what kind of transaction, does it drop schema, does it show queries..align queries..etc
   IT'S LIKE CONFIGURING HOW JPA NEEDS TO BEHAVE WHEN IT NEEDS TO CONNECT DB
