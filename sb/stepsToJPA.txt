1. new maven project -> finish
2. dep to add -> h2db, jpa 

to do: 1. tell where db is ..(cnnection string..etc)
       2. how to connect 
       
 * we created a simple java class named JpaStarterMain 
 * -------- create a model class, persistence context ----------
 
 src-> main-> resources -> meta-inf -> persistence.xml created
 this file contains persistence context 
        -> bunch of info's about what db 
        -> location
        -? connection stringlike userid, pwd, 
        -> how jpa needs to behave
        -> what kind of transaction, does it drop schema, does it show queries..align queries..etc
   IT'S LIKE CONFIGURING HOW JPA NEEDS TO BEHAVE WHEN IT NEEDS TO CONNECT DB 
   
   ADD CODE IN PERSISTANCE.XML
   
   -> now i know how to connect db, where db is. 
   what to do with db?
   if emp db na, employees
   if ecommerce db na, products/order
   
   
   CREATE A JAVA CLASS => EMPLOYEE ,2 PROPS, GETTER,SETTER, @ID
   
   ------------persist the entities with entity manager-----------
   now we have instance of class
   we need to tell jpa to save it 
   1st added -> dep added jpa
   2nd  did -> told where db is
   3 rd did -> mapping (entity, table , id )
   4 to do -> save data 
   how>?by getting entity manager
                   ----------------   -> object /service 
                   entity? data holder 
                    need instance of entit manager, for that need instance of entity factory 
                    
   ------- 02 -11-2022 ------------------------------
   
   1. validate 
      check if entity definitions in java classes match the table definitions in db. it's not gonna do anything
   2. update
   3. create -> drops everything and starts
   4. create-drop -> drops everything and starts.
   diff?
   once persistance is closed, create-drop > will drop everything 
    once persistance is closed, create      > will not drop everything 
   
   
   hbm2ddl.auto create-drop :
If the value is create-drop then, Hibernate first checks for a table and do the necessary operations and finally drops the table after all the operations were completed.
hbm2ddl.auto Create :
If the value is CREATE then the hibernate first drops the existing tables data and structure, then creates new tables and executes the operations on the newly created tables.

for accesscard 1 -> assigned to employee 1
for accesscard 2 -> assigned to employee 2    (1 - 1  relationship )
   
       emp id 1 -> card of id 3
       emp id 2 -> card of id 4 
       
       
       Don't do EAGER FETCH...JUZ DO LAZY FETCH 
     
     output is:   Employee [id=1, name=hello, age=0, ssn=123, dob=15:51:28, type=FULL_TIME, debugString=null, card=AccessCard [id=3, issuedDate=2022-11-03 15:51:28.316, isActive=true, firmwareVersion=1.0.0]]
     
     AccessCard [id=3, issuedDate=2022-11-03 15:51:28.316, isActive=true, firmwareVersion=1.0.0]

single employee can contain multiple payslip 

default:
1 to 1 relation - default fetch type - eager
1 to many relation- default fetch type - lazy


many to many relationships:


group: minebrat group ,dev team 2
employee a(dev in mb)  --> whatsapp group of minebrat, team2 
employee b (tester in mb )   ->whatsapp group of minebrat , not in team2 group 


e1 -> both groups
e2 -? part of only one group
