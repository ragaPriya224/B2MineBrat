1. new maven project -> finish
2. dep to add -> h2db, jpa 

to do: 1. tell where db is ..(cnnection string..etc)
       2. how to connect 
       
 * we created a simple java class named JpaStarterMain 
 * -------- create a model class, persistence context ----------
 
 src-> main-> resources -> meta-inf -> persistence.xml created
 this file contains persistence context 
        -> bunch of info's about what db 
        -> location
        -? connection stringlike userid, pwd, 
        -> how jpa needs to behave
        -> what kind of transaction, does it drop schema, does it show queries..align queries..etc
   IT'S LIKE CONFIGURING HOW JPA NEEDS TO BEHAVE WHEN IT NEEDS TO CONNECT DB 
   
   ADD CODE IN PERSISTANCE.XML
   
   -> now i know how to connect db, where db is. 
   what to do with db?
   if emp db na, employees
   if ecommerce db na, products/order
   
   
   CREATE A JAVA CLASS => EMPLOYEE ,2 PROPS, GETTER,SETTER, @ID
   
   ------------persist the entities with entity manager-----------
   now we have instance of class
   we need to tell jpa to save it 
   1st added -> dep added jpa
   2nd  did -> told where db is
   3 rd did -> mapping (entity, table , id )
   4 to do -> save data 
   how>?by getting entity manager
                   ----------------   -> object /service 
                   entity? data holder 
                    need instance of entit manager, for that need instance of entity factory
